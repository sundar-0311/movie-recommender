🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A content-based movie recommendation system built using the TMDB dataset. The system recommends movies based on similarity in movie metadata such as genres, keywords, cast, crew, and plot overview.

📌 Overview

This project implements a content-based filtering approach where each movie is represented using a unified textual feature vector. Recommendations are generated by computing cosine similarity between movies. An interactive Streamlit web app is provided for real-time movie recommendations.
